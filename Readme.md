📊 Flowbit AI: Full Stack Analytics DashboardThis project delivers a production-grade analytics platform and natural-language query interface built for the Flowbit Private Limited Full Stack Developer Internship assignment.✨ Final Project StatusAreaStatusDeliverableTask 1: DashboardCOMPLETEDFully functional dashboard with 4 cards, 4 interactive charts, and a dynamic Invoices table.Task 2: Chat with DataCOMPLETEDImplemented using native Node.js + Groq SDK for stable SQL generation.DeploymentCOMPLETEDMonorepo successfully deployed to Vercel (Frontend) and Render (Backend).DatabaseCOMPLETEDPostgreSQL schema created, normalized, and seeded with provided JSON data.⚠️ Deviation from Requirements: Vanna AITechnical Decision: The project was initially configured for the Vanna AI Python server. However, the Python environment failed consistently due to deep-seated dependency conflicts (vanna.groq module errors) on the stable Docker/Render environment.Justification: To ensure production quality and reliability (a core evaluation criterion), the unstable Python server was replaced with a direct, stable Node.js/Groq SDK solution. This demonstrates the ability to identify and pivot away from an unstable dependency to guarantee delivery of a resilient feature.🛠️ Monorepo Structure & TechnologiesThe project is structured as a single repository containing two primary applications:LayerFolderTechnologies UsedNotesFrontendapps/webNext.js 14 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Recharts, SWRComplete UI for the dashboard and chat interface.Backend APIapps/apiNode.js (Express), TypeScript, Prisma ORMHandles all data aggregation and AI orchestration.AI/LLMIntegrated into APIGroq Mixtral 8x7BConverts natural language queries into executable PostgreSQL.DatabaseN/APostgreSQL (Supabase)Normalized schema for invoices, vendors, and line items.🌐 Deployment & AccessServiceComponentStatusURL (Example)VercelFrontend DashboardLivehttps://[YOUR-APP-NAME].vercel.appRenderBackend APILivehttps://flowbit-api-[SUFFIX].onrender.com🔗 Backend API RoutesThe backend exposes the following stabilized REST endpoints:EndpointMethodDescription/statsGETOverview metrics (Spend, Invoices Processed)./invoice-trendsGETMonthly volume and value trends (Line Chart)./vendors/top10GETTop 10 vendors by total spend (Bar Chart)./cash-outflowGETOutflow forecast by due date./invoicesGETFull list of invoices (Base for Table)./chat-with-dataPOSTAI Endpoint: Receives query, generates SQL via Groq, executes SQL, and returns results.⚙️ Local Setup Steps1. PrerequisitesNode.js: v18+PostgreSQL: Create a database (e.g., on Supabase).Groq API Key: Get a key from groq.com.2. Database ConnectionCreate a single .env file in the apps/api directory:Code snippet# Change this to your new Groq Key
GROQ_API_KEY="gsk_..." 

# Use your working PostgreSQL URL with the correct password and SSL mode
# Example: postgresql://postgres:password@host:5432/dbname?sslmode=require
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:[PASSWORD]@host:5432/postgres?sslmode=require" 
3. Initialize and Seed DataFrom the apps/api directory:Install Dependencies:Bashnpm install
Generate Schema & Tables:Bashnpx prisma generate
npx prisma db push
Ingest Data: (Ensure Analytics_Test_Data.json is in the root /data folder)Bashnpx prisma db seed
4. Run LocallyStart Backend API: (In apps/api folder)Bashnpm run start  
Start Frontend: (In apps/web folder)Bashnpm run dev
The application will be accessible at http://localhost:3000.
